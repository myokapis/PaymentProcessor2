Envelope
- Add data access, models

Contexts
- maybe create a card context instead of a card
- look at other helpers and integrate them into the context
  - card brand (?rely on card object and add to card context?)
  - credential on file (call this payment context)
  - product context (?add to card context? not sure if this is reliable)
  - transaction conditions (?add to card context?)
  - transaction method (?add to card context?)

Metadata
- make it into an object instead of a dictionary?
